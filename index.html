              <h1>Hope For Children</h1>
              <p>The original site did not look like a trustworthy site to be taking volunteers or donations. It wasn’t inviting whatsoever. We wanted to show that this was a site that could actually bring hope to children.
                We cut a lot of unnecessary text as to not overwhelm the user.
                Unfortunately, the originally owners of the website did not want anything to do with our redesign because we really brought this website to life and made it very playful for both kids and parents.

              <h1>The Problem Statement</h1>
              <p>Each of us did at least 2 personal interviews to collect data but we also sent a survey out for more quantitative data. Here we prioritized our information and thought of a user flow for our "typical" user persona. With that, we split up the different parts of the user flow between the four of us to start making sketches of our own ideas of what the app would look like. We took bits and pieces from everyones sketches to start making our wireframes.</p>
              <p>Our user that we came up with is wary of unknown non-profit organizations and, though he sometimes donates to select causes, is overall unlikely to volunteer his time. Currently, he does not feel he can trust organizations and their online platforms and is hesitant to dedicate more resources to causes.</p>
             <p>Our goal is to make things more transparent and trustworthy on the Hope for Children website. We want to increase discoverability and awareness to motivate users to donate and volunteer.</p>

                <h2>Task 1:</h2>
                  <p>Can you show me how you would learn more about the Hope for Children organization and what they do?</p>
                <h2>Task 2</h2>
                  <p>Next, could you demonstrate how you would determine what the organization specifically does to help fight child abuse?</p> 
                <h2>Task 3</h2>
                  <p>Next, could you demonstrate how you would sign up to Volunteer?</p>
                <h2>Task 4 </h2>
                  <p>Next, could you show me how you would Donate to the organization - specifically how you would donate to a special cause?</p>
                <h2>Task 5</h2>
                  <p>Lastly, could you demonstrate how you would find examples of some of the ways Hope for Children has helped specific individuals or families?</p>
                <h2>IMAGE TEST</h2>
                  <p>Compare the two images - Which do you prefer for this website?</p>

                <h2>Test Results</h2>
                <p>In the Low-Fi Prototype Tests, we found that everyone could easily completed each task and we didn't get much negative feedback.</p>
                <p>During the Mid-High Prototype Tests, again we found that everyone could easily completed each task and in some cases, they continued further to the next task. The only item that was slightly delayed was in going to the “How We Help” page. Some people also thought that "Sign Up" was "Sign Up" areas were only for the Toy Drive event and did not want to click on the button. </p> 
                <p>The last test we did was the A/B and Preference Tests which we found out that more people were in favor of the family image rather than the two kids. They felt it was bolder and made more sense with the website.</p>
